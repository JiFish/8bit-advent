# An 8-Bit Adventure

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>
<div class='wide'>
##### By Joseph Fowler

\page

# Introduction

The party have been transported to an strange world, filled with the tropes of turn-based JRPG games in general and Final Fantasy in particular. They must deal with the limitations of an 8-bit world, crawl a short dungeon and defeat the evil knight Garland in order to get back home.

This is a short comedy adventure, designed for a group around levels 4 - 7. It is supposed to be completed in a single 3 - 4 hour sitting. The players shouldn't find the difficulty very challenging, the fun is in the silliness of the setting. It's designed to be slotted in to an existing campaign as a one-off special adventure.

Come up with your own way they get transported to this land. Maybe they get pulled in to a strange portal, maybe they fall down a rabbit hole. Whatever is appropriate for your campaign.

### Using this document

The SRD is a requirement. Most item and monster stats are referenced directly from it. New NPC and monster stats are provided inline and new items are documented in Appendix A.

Player versions of maps are provided in Appendix C.

> Text in boxes of this style is written to be read aloud to your players.

### Setting
Retroguardia doesn't have a deep back-story or history. It doesn't need one. The world is intentionally very shallow to mimic the very early video-games of this type.

If you feel it needs fleshing out more, you can pull in ideas from video-games you have played.

### Feedback

Enjoyed this short module? Questions, corrections or other feedback? You can contact me via twitter [@JiFish](http://twitter.com/JiFish).

### Pacing
There's a lot to do in one session: a village, a castle, an obstacle, a dungeon and a boss encounter. In order to get it all done, you are going to have to keep the pace of the adventure moving.

You can use the shallowness of the JRPG setting to help with this. Here are some tips:

* Fights should be quick and easy. (With the exception of Garland.)
* Other than a few key exceptions, most NPCs have little to say, simply repeating their assigned dialog in different ways.
* If your players are really stuck, you can have an NPC break character to help them.
* The world is bound by JRPG tropes, but the players are not. If they can think of a way to subvert the narrative that helps them jump ahead, let them do that. Play it to the comedy of it.
* The story is very linear. But if the party wants to go "off the rails" let them! It will only get them to the ending faster.
* Game going too quickly? Throw in some extra random encounters.

## Money in Retroguardia (Gil)
Gil are tiny brass coins with a central hole. It is the currency of Retroguardia and even the monsters carry it.

**Shops refuse to accept other coins**, even if they seem valuable. For a DM's rule of thumb, 1 gp = 20 gil or 1 gil = 5 cp. Don't tell the players this conversion. Let them be confused.

Smart players can sell goods to shops to earn Gil. Really smart players might sell their gold coins to the weapons or armor shops for metal recycling.

After a fight, the party should find Gil amounting to around twice the XP gained.

Like Disney Bucks, Gil is practically worthless once the adventure ends. They might be able to sell it for 1 cp per Gil for the novelty or scrap - if they can find a buyer.

### Gil Toss / Gil Rain
Players who know the games might try throwing Gil to do damage. In this adventure, 50 Gil thrown does 1 hp of damage. The Gil is not recoverable.

Once the players return home throwing the coins does nothing - with hilarious consequences.

## Combat Mechanics in Retroguardia

The changes are designed to both speed up combat and reference classic JRPG battle systems.

* All players and monsters are in attack range of each other.
* This counts for spells too. Area spells will not hit friendly targets.
* The disengage, dash and attack of opportunity actions are not used. The cover rule is also not needed.
* During movement, players may only Change Rows or Run. See below.

> You have entered a battle! What do you wish to do? ATTACK, MAGIC, USE, CHANGE ROW or RUN?

### Run
A successful DC 14 Dexterity check is required to run away. If a character runs away the are no longer considered in range to make or take any attack. They can rejoin the combat at any time with an 
action. If half the party has run away, the rest also escape the combat automatically.

\page

### Change Rows

While in the back row, all melee attack rolls made by or against that character are at disadvantage. Players may freely change between front and back row with their action

### Optional: Scrolls for all!
Just like in a video-game, any character can read any scroll, regardless of the spells available to their class or even possessing spellcasting at all. You can indicate this to players when they see a scroll.

> Ordinarily, a scroll of this type would be unintelligible to you. However, strangely, not only can you read the scroll, you think you may be able to cast it!

### Optional: Change to initiative
To speed things up even more, consider these changes to initiative:

* Roll initiative once at the start and keep that order for the the whole session. Give them advantage on the roll.
* Players may choose an initiative below what they rolled. (Useful if they want a more optimal turn order.)
* Start new combats with the player who was next due a turn in the last combat.

## When players try to break things
The party is being presented with a very strange scenario and one that is in many ways intentionally linear and limiting. It's pefectly normal for them to want to test the boundaries of this world to figure out what will and won't work in Retroguardia.

This story is supposed to not only be funny, but also fun. Maybe they want to indulge in a particularly ridiculous JRPG trope or show how the setting is broken in some way. So as far as you can indulge them, let them explore that.

But if they try to break things too much, here are some potenitally useful antidotes. These are only suggestions.

### The party has found a get rich quick scheme or are grinding battles for Gil and XP.
The scenerio is designed to get Gil in to the hands of the players quickly. There's no fun in having a new currency if the players don't ever get enough to spend. So let them do it to a point. If things go too far, shopkeepers can run out of money to buy items and random encounters can stop:
> It appears that your mighty battles have scared away all the monsters in this area!

```
```

### The party question an NPC too much or try to make them break character
Most NPCs are very shallow characters that simply repeat variations on a single line of dialog. If a player should push one too far, they might have an existential crisis:

> NPC: *"Oh my word, you're right! I'm nothing but a random NPC handing out dialog to passing adventurers! My life has no meaning! I don't even have stats! ARRRRGGGH!"*
>
>&nbsp;
>
> They run away in to the distance, continuing to scream.

### They try to rob a shop or the gambling hut
You might want to not let them do this. Ordinarily such actions could have serious consequences, but in this bubble world there wouldn't really be any.
> Amazingly, the 3ft. high counter-top seems to be unscalable.

### They find a way to really break combat
The new combat rules are very loose. A character may have an abillity that exploits them and removes all the challenge. Nerf or restrict them if they come up. Maybe that ability simply doesn't work under the strange rules of this world.

Combat is still designed to be very easy, so hopefully it's not too bitter a pill to swallow.

### The nuclear option
You should never need this. But if your players really will not stop trying to break stuff, or try to escape the scenario entirely, this could serve as a pointed reminder that this world does not work under the same rules as they are used to.
> The world around you becomes strange and distorted. All sound freezes except a single note of music, without end. Everything becomes blocky - even more so than normal - and starts to flash rapid colors. Then everything goes black. A word enters your vision: "ERROR."

Reset the players to an earlier stage in the game. Don't take any progress away, but this is an opportunity to point them the right direction.

# 1. The Overworld

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/kbhqrPe.png'  style='width:100%; image-rendering:pixelated'  />

_(For the player versions of maps, See Appendix C.)_

</div>

\page

## Random Encounters
Every now and then the party gets randomly attacked. The attacks seem to come from nowhere - with no warning at all. Don't forget to give Gil after battles.

Don't overdo the random encounters. The game is on a clock. I suggest doing an encounter:

* Near the start of the game. (See 1.1.)
* On the way to The Broken Bridge.
* If they decide to wander past The Cave.
* If they seek out an encounter. (Within reason.)

##### Encounter table
Roll a d12 and consult the SRD for stats:

| 1d12 | Encounter | Loot |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 - 6  | 5x Goblins | 500 Gil |
| 7 - 10 | 2x Ochre Jellys | 2000 Gil |
| 11 - 12 | Hill Giant | 3500 Gil |

## Features
The following features are accessable on the map. 
### 1.1 Starting Location


After transporting your characters to this world _(see Introduction)_ you might want to start right off with a fight! This gives you a chance to introduce the changed combat mechanics and give them some Gil.

Start with 5 Goblins. (See the SRD for stats.) **Don't forget to give the party 500 Gil after the battle.**

After the fight, the party find themselves on the far south of the overworld map. A short walk from Retroguardia Town.


#### Mog 
The party is approached by the friendly moogle, Mog.
> <img src='https://i.imgur.com/B8Y5AjI.png' style='float:right; padding-left: 20px;'/> Mog: *"Are you okay, Kupo? I'm Mog, the traveling Moogle!"* 

If the party should ask how they got here, or how to get home:

> Mog: *"I'm not sure, Kupo. Maybe someone is Retroguardia Town can help you?"*

After the conversation Mog will go his own way.

### 1.2 Impassable Obstacles

You should hint:

* The sea is too vast to sail off the map.
* The mountains are too tall to climb.
* The eastern forest is to dense to pass.
* The northern river is too rapid to cross.

If the players still try and make a good attempt, they will find an invisible, impassable wall blocking their path. Lazy video-game devs!

### 1.3 Chocobo Forest (Side-Quest)
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/JQvnWYx.png' style='width:100%; image-rendering:pixelated' />

> You enter a small grove in the forest. Three large yellow birds are here. They seem fairly tame.

Players can capture Chocobos with a successful Animal Handling check, DC 14. Or if they want to jump right on an Acrobatics check, DC 16.

A single chocobo can carry 2 riders. While riding a chocobo, the players will not be attacked. You may wish to hint at this by having them ride right past a random encounter.

5 minutes after dismounting a chocobo, it will return back here to the forest.

Chocobos can also fly up to 500 ft when fed a special kind of pepper called Dead Pepper. (See 4. The Broken Bridge and Appendix A, Items.)

If you need Chocobo stats for whatever reason, you can use the Horse stats in the SRD.

#### Obtaining a Dead Pepper

The following NPCs will offer the party 4 dead peppers if they mention chocobos:

* Mog
* Princess Garnet
* Yuna
* Any old man or lady
* Weirdly, Garland. But it's probably a glitch and it happens way too late in the game anyway.

> _"Oh, you're interested in Chocobos? Here take these Dead Peppers. They say chocobos will do ANYTHING for a Dead Pepper."_

#### Chocobo Feather

If a player becomes particularly attached to their chocobo, you can choose to have it drop a Chocobo Feather. (See Appendix A, Items.)

The Feather is a rare, expensive and useful item. The player should do something extraordinary to earn it.

\page

### 1.4 Gambling Hut (Side-Quest)
In this side quest the party has a chance to gamble their hard earned Gil.

Biggs and Wedge have set up a game of chance here to make some money off passing adventurers. The odds are not good, but the party could obtain some rare items.

If interrogated, Biggs and Wedge will confess there is a very high chance of getting nothing (33%) and a very small chance of a rare item (2%)

&nbsp;

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/LjmXEIb.png' style='width:100%; image-rendering:pixelated' />


> Biggs: _"Welcome to the..."_
>
> Wedge: _"Gambling Hut!"_
>
> Biggs: _"Win rare items!"_
>
> Wedge: _"Win nothing at all!"_
>
> Biggs: _"Give it a try!"_
>
> Wedge: _"Open a box for 700 Gil!"_
>
> Biggs & Wedge: _"You know you want to!"_

After each box is opened, the box is replaced and they are all shuffled.

If a party should manage to get the same Super Rare item twice, they have to re-roll. Biggs and Wedge only have one of each.

<div class='descriptive'>
#### Rob the place?

If the party attempts to attack Biggs and Wedge or steal the treasure, they will be surprised to find the 3 ft high counter is unscalable.
</div>

```
```


##### Prize Table
Roll 1d100 and choose from the table:

| &nbsp;1d100&nbsp; | Prize |
|:------:|:-------------|
| 1 - 33 | Nothing! |
| 34 - 55 | Rations x 5 |
| 56 - 70 | Dead Peppers x 4 |
| 71 - 80 | 500 Gil |
| 81 - 87 | Potion of Healing |
| 88 - 91 | 1000 Gil |
| 92 - 94 | A Garnet Gemstone worth 3000 Gil / 150 GP |
| 95 - 96 | A Phoenix Down _(See Appendix A, Items.)_ |
| 97 - 98 | 5000 Gil |
| 99 | Ribbon _(See Appendix A, Items.)_ |
| 100 | Chocobo Feather _(See Appendix A, Items.)_

### 1.5 The Desert
If the players venture in to the desert, they will encounter the deadly Cactuar. There's no point in defeating the foe other than bragging rights and some XP.

**Note that players can run from the Cactuar without a check**... and they probably should.

_(For the player versions of maps, See Appendix C.)_
</div>


> Retroguardia is a small hamlet, with an inn and a few shops. Houses for the tiny population are surprisingly absent.

## NPCs in Town
Most NPCs are very shallow characters that simply repeat variations on a single line of dialog.

> Woman: _"Welcome, Warriors of Lig... Oh! You're not them. Well, welcome to Retroguardia Town all the same."_

> &nbsp;

> Man: _"The evil knight, Garland, is bringing in the monsters outside of town through a portal."_

> &nbsp;

> Guard: _"Retroguardia castle is to the north, you should you speak to King Edgar about getting home."_

> &nbsp;

> Woman: _"This town is safe from the monsters outside because of the protection from the castle."_

```
```

> Old Woman: _"You're not the first group of adventurers to pass through this town. The warriors of light passed through a while ago. Something about saving the world."_

> &nbsp;

> Guard: _"I've been sent from the castle to protect this town."_

> &nbsp;

> Old Man: _"Do you mind? I'm having a whiz back here. (cough) These two shops here sell magic scrolls. Great for spellcasters!"_

If the players try to talk to an NPC for the second time read the following, along with some small talk:

> The people in this town seem to lack in-depth conversational skills.

### 2.2 - The Fountain and Dancer
A central fountain surrounded by trees. Water bubbles pleasantly. Nearby a woman dressed in a dancer's dress pouts.

> Yuna: _"I'm Yuna. I'd love to dance for you, but I lost my dancing shoes in the castle, dancing for the princess!"_

If asked how she knows the princess she blushes and says:
> 
> Yuna: _"Me and Princess Garnet are friends."_
>

If the party should retrieve the dancer's shoes:

> Yuna: _"Thank you!"_
>
> &nbsp;
>
> The dancer dances her seductive dance around the fountain.
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Yuna: _"Let me reward you!"_
>
> &nbsp;
>
> She kisses whomever returned the shoes on the cheek and drops a bag in to their hand.

The Dancer's Reward is 3000 Gil.

### 2.3 - The Inn
Characters can spend the night in the inn for 100 Gil per person. This counts as a long rest.
> The party share a single room with a bed each. You fall to sleep as soon as your head hits the pillow. The night seems to be over in an instant, but you are well rested.

### 2.4 - The Well
If they investigate the well:
> Just beneath the water of the well, you find a pouch containing hundreds of small brass coins with a hole in the middle.

> Priest: _"I see they fell in battle. I will resurrect them."_

The priest will perform an arcane ritual which has the effect of the Raise Dead spell. _(See the SRD.)_

\page

#### If a party member is poisoned or diseased:
> Priest: _"I see you are poisoned. Allow me to help."_

The priest will perform an arcane ritual which has the effect of the Lesser Restoration spell. _(See the SRD.)_

## Features
### 3.1 - Princess Garnet's Room
Princess Garnet is in love with Yuna the Dancer girl from the town. She is more than happy to return her shoes if the party ask.

The guard outside, Steiner, is very protective of the princess and won't let the party inside without good reason. However, he is aware of her affection for Yuna and will stand aside if the players mention her.

> Princess Garnet: _"Of course, thank you for returning them to her. Please ask her to come visit again, soon."_

### 3.2 - Treasure Rooms
An old man stands guard outside the rooms, the doors are locked with normal locks that can be defeated by a good lock pick or knock spell. They can also be opened by the key, freely offered by King Edgar (see 3.3.)

The party are not pursued or penalized in any way for stealing the treasure.

When the party first approaches the rooms:

> Old Man: _"These rooms contain a lot of treasure you know!"_
>
> &nbsp;
>
> The old man promptly falls in to a deep sleep.

The old man is really asleep, but could still be awoken by noisy adventurers. If the old man catches them:

> Old Man: _"Trying to nab the treasure are you? He-he. Move along now you little scamps."_
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Once again, the old man falls to sleep.

#### The West Treasure Chests
Contain:
* 200 Gil
* 300 Gil
* A Great Sword _(See the SRD.)_

#### The East Treasure Chests
Contain:
* 250 Gil
* 500 Gil
* A Potion of Healing _(See the SRD.)_

### 3.3 - The Throne Room
One man guards the door and he is happy to let past any non-threatening person.

>Guard: _"Please speak to King Edgar, inside."_

&nbsp;

> The King sits at his throne, looking to the distance as if in deep thought. His Queen stands to his side.

King Edgar and Queen Hilda are friendly and charming. They are happy to help the party in any way they can. They offer the party a bit of sanity after dealing with one line responses from most NPCs. You should feel free to improvise extra dialog for them.

\page

If they speak to Hilda:

>Queen Hilda: _"I am Queen Hilda. Welcome adventurers to our kingdom. I trust your visit has been a pleasant one?"_


If they speak to Edgar:

>King Edgar: _"Hail, Adventurers. I am Kind Edgar. You know I used to be an adventurer myself in my youth. How may I be of help?"_

If they ask about how they got here or how to get home:

>Queen Hilda: _"The evil Knight, Garland, has been using the Master Portal to bring in monsters from other worlds. He must have sent you here by mistake. You must find the Master Portal if you have any hope of getting home."_


If they ask about Garland or the Master Portal:

>King Edgar: _"Garland used to be my right-hand man. But he stole the Master Portal and has taken it to his layer in the mountains, past the broken bridge."_

If they ask for help with the Broken Bridge:

>Queen Hilda: _"The bridge cannot be repaired, but I will ask Cid, our master inventor if he can help you. He will wait for you downstairs."_

If they ask about Garnet:

>Queen Hilda: _"Garnet is our only child. Someday she will be Queen."_

If they ask about Yuna or her shoes:

>King Edgar: _"Yuna is Princess Garnet's girlfriend. She's always leaving her stuff around the place."_

If they ask for money or supplies, they offer the keys to the treasure rooms.
>King Edgar: _"Take whatever you need and leave the keys with the old man outside."_

```
```

### 3.4 Cid
If the party has been offered Cid's help by The King and Queen, they will find him on the way out of the castle.

>Cid: _"Sure, I'll help you get across the bridge! I've got a new invention that will help."_
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Cid has joined the party!

> Cid: _"You'll see when we get there!"_

Depending on the number of players in the party, you may wish to make Cid a non-combatant.

# 4. The Broken Bridge
&nbsp;

If the party reaches the broken bridge before going to the town or castle they should find it very difficult to cross. Otherwise, there are a number of options to help them.

> The bridge still partially stands, as if a great force - or perhaps sea-monster - has simply shorn through it. The remaining parts are fairly stable, but there is a gap of at least 500 feet. The angry water rages from below. One part of the missing section juts out like a giant boulder in the water below.

#### If the party have Chocobos
If the party has chocobos, they can fly the gap if fed a dead pepper:

> Chocobo: _"KWHAAA!!"_
>
> &nbsp;
>
> You feed the dead pepper to the chocobo and it immediately takes to the sky! The chocobo flies majestically over the gap. Well, as majestically as the lumbering bird can manage.

If the party does not have dead peppers they might be able to convince the chocobos to fly with an Animal Handling check, DC 18.

#### If Cid is with the party

>Cid: _"Don't worry folks! My portable peddle-powered airship'll get us across the gap!"_
>
>&nbsp;
>
>Cid begins to quickly construct an unstable looking device with all manner of chains and sprockets. The device has a propeller on the top and many sets of peddles.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If the party wish to try the device, have them all roll strength checks and sum the results.

If the number is satisfactory:
>The improbable device sails smoothly across the gap in the bridge. You just make it to the other side, out of breath and amazed.

If the number is not satisfactory, everyone in party takes **1d6 bludgeoning damage** from the fall. They must find another way across.
>The improbable device lifts in to the air... then crashes in to heap where it reverts to the pile of junk from which it was built.

#### If the party decide to swim
Players familar with videogame tropes may correctly guess that that swimming won't damage their inventory. If they try this, you can optionally have them make athletics checks. Either way, they should get an encounter: four Reef Sharks. _(See the SRD for stats.)_

#### If the party head to the docks for a boat
See 4.1 The Docks.

#### Other ways across

Allow the players to think up their own way to cross the 500 foot gap. If the solution is silly, all the better. They are playing in a world of computer-game logic after all.

Some suggestions:
* Everybody tie the 50 foot of rope from all the adventure's kits together, then tie all the clothes and blankets to it to make an very unsturdy rope.
* Create a crude raft from a nearby trees.
* Collapse the rest of the bridge somehow and then use the wreckage as giant stepping stones.

## 4.1 The Docks (Side-Quest)
**The dock to the south of the map is only useful once the party discovers Garland is past the broken bridge.** 
If the party investigate beforehand:
> This strange dock is merely a small paved area with moorings. No buildings or people are in sight. You can see distant ships on the horizon.

Otherwise:
> This strange dock is merely a small paved area with moorings. No buildings are in sight.
>
> A ship is docked here the nameplate reads "Syldra" and it flies the Jolly Roger. Clearly, these pirates do not feel the need to be subtle. A loud ruckus can be heard from deck. The pirates are enjoying their grog.

The crew consists of Captain Faris and her six crew-men. Although Faris is a woman, she dresses and acts just like her male crew.
The pirates are friendly and welcoming. Faris offers bottles of foul-smelling grog to visitors. **The grog does 1d4 damage if consumed. If not consumed, it eats through the bottom of the bottle.**

&nbsp;

>Faris: _"Join us! Get these people bottles of Grog! Now then, what brings heroes aboard my ship?"_

If asked, the pirates will ferry the party to wherver they'd like to go for the outrageous price of 10,000 Gil. Unlike shops, Faris is willing to accept gold or jewels for payment. 10,000 Gil = 500 gp.

&nbsp;

>Faris: _"My fine crew will sail you anywhere on the map for the low fee of 10,000 Gil."_

If Cid is present, he will comment on the excessive fee.

>Cid: _"10,000 Gil! That's daylight robbery!"_

If defeated in combat, the pirates will carry the party for free. The pirates have no booty to loot. They already spent it all on grog.

Use the Bandit stat block for the 6 pirates. _(See the SRD.)_ Faris also joins the combat.

# 5. The Dungeon

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/lBvxAgS.png'  style='width:100%'  />
</div>

## Random Encounters

Every now and then the party gets randomly attacked. The attacks seem to come from nowhere.
<div class='descriptive'>
### Note!
You have a chance to tune the speed of your adventure at this point. If the game is running long, only have a single random encounter. If you need to fill up time, do as many as you need. JRPG dungeons are known for having high encounter rates, so this is in theme.
</div>

```
```

##### Encounter table
Roll 1d6 and consult the SRD for stats:

| 1d6 | Encounter | Loot |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 - 2  | 6x Skeletons | 500 Gil |
| 3 - 4  | 4x Reef Shark | 500 Gil |
| 5 | 3x Giant Spider | 1000 Gil |
| 6| 2x Ochre Jelly and 3x Skeletons | 2000 Gil |

##### Reef Sharks?
Ignore the "Water Breathing" trait on Reef Sharks and read the following:

> Curiously, the sharks seem unbothered by the complete lack of water in the cave and instead are swimming through the air.

\page

## Features

None of the doors in the dungeon are locked - unless you have a character who can pick locks. In which case, they are all locked.

### 5.1 - Entrance

>As you enter through the passage in the cliff-face you see a staircase leading down. The steps lead to a strange cave. The rocks glow with a orange light and are warm to the touch. Footprints indicate someone has entered recently.

If Cid is with the party add:
> Cid: _"Well, heroes. The time has come for me to depart. I wish you luck with your quest."_
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Cid has left the party.

### 5.2 Chests
None of the chests are locked or trapped.
##### Chest 1
* Potion of Healing. _(See the SRD.)_

##### Chest 2
* 3000 Gil

##### Chest 3
* A standard shield. _(See the SRD.)_

##### Chest 4
* A Phoenix Down. _(See Appendix A, Items.)_

### 5.3 Zubat Ambush!
> As soon as you open the door you are ambushed by strange bat-like creatures. For some reason they keep repeating the word "Zubat, Zubat!"

The party encounter 6x Zubats. During this battle, be sure to mention that the Zubats 'faint' rather than die when reduced to 0hp. The party does not find any Gil after this fight.

##### Confusion Table
| 1d10 | Behavior |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 - 4  | The creature can not move or take actions this turn. |
| 5  | The creature must use its action to make a melee attack against itself. |
| 6 - 7 | The creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a random target in reach. |
| 8 - 9 | The creature can act and move normally. |
| 10 | The creature snaps out of confusion. |

### 5.4 Mog, Again
Just before entering Garland's chamber, the party once again encounters Mog, the friendly Moogle.

>Mog: _"Hello again, Kupo!"_

After briefly catching up, Mog will offer the party two choices:

>Mog: _"Would like you like to SAVE YOUR GAME or MOGSHOP?"_

#### Mogshop
If the party ask after MOGSHOP, Mog will sell the party any items available in the shops of Retroguardia Town. (See 2.1.)

#### Save
Mog will be unable to explain what "SAVE YOUR GAME" means. If the party choose to do it:

\page

> The moogle freezes for 10 seconds.
>
> &nbsp;
>
>Mog: _"Your game has been saved, Kupo!"_

If the party falls in the final battle with Garland, they should re-appear here. Garland however will still be damaged from the fight and won't be happy about the party "cheating."

>Garland: _"Hey, no fair! How come I don't get a chance to heal up?"_

### 5.5 Garland

Garland has been driven mad by life in this mediocre, poorly built world. He desires nothing more than to escape in to the party's reality where he can be a true villain - not just the first level boss.

He is making his final preparations to leave guarded by two skeletons. _(See the SRD for stats.)_ Unfortunately Garland is as two-dimensional as the world he wishes to escape.

> Garland: _"Who dares invade the layer of Garland, arbiter of the Master Portal?"_

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If the party ask after the Master Portal:

> Garland: _"No-one may see the Master Portal, but I!"_

If the party mentions getting home and/or mention how they got here.

> Garland: _"Perfect! The Master Portal is finally attuned to world suitable for my escape. I shall leave this paper-thin facade behind and be re-born in your world!"_

Garland will spill his life-story with not too much prompting.

> Garland: _"I'm tired of this pathetic trope-ridden world. With it's perfect little royal family ruling over a land with a grand population of three dozen. Yes, I stole the Master Portal. To find my escape! I may have accidentally summoned a few monsters. But now I have a better world to conquer!"_

A fight is inevitable. Garland will refuse access to The Master Portal and continue to threaten their world. Even if the party is able to negotiate a deal, Garland will stab them in the back as soon as possible.

>
> ***Thundara.*** 1 action, range: 100 foot line from self, duration: Instantaneous. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
>
> ***Blizzaga.*** 1 action, range: 300 feet (20-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder), duration: Instantaneous. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.
>

\page

#### Victory!

Garland's weapons and armor are gone, but the party can retrieve Excalipoor. Inside the chest, they find a Ribbon. See Appendix A, Items.

After defeating Garland, there is little time to waste, next door the portal is collapsing!

> You hear several loud cracks, as if of thunder, coming from the unopened door to the west.

### 5.6 - The Master Portal

This is the final room in the dungeon and it contains the Master Portal.

A successful Arcana or Intelligence check will reveal the portal is collapsing and the party does not have long to pass through back to their world.

> As you enter the room you see a freestanding frame, similar to that of a mirror. However, instead of your reflections, you can see your own world on the other side of the Master Portal. The image is disrupted by large moving cracks, as if black lighting dancing across the image.

#### Plan B
If the party fail to enter the portal in time or something else goes wrong, there is another option. If they return the Master Portal's frame to Retroguardia Castle, Cid can figure out how to reopen it.

However, once opened he realizes the portal will collapse again at any minute.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

> Cid: _"It's unstable!! Best jump through now, I dunno if I can open it again!!"_

#### Plan C
Probably don't strand them in Retroguadia forever.

You could homebrew an escape story for the start of the next session. Or use good old-fashioned deus ex machina - another JRPG trope.

## 6. End Game
Once the party has passed through the portal.

> You pass through the frame of the Master Portal - a chill passing through your bodies as you do so. On the other side you find yourselves standing excatly when and where you left. You feel much happier to be back in a semi-sane world.
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Somewhere, off in a distant and odd plane of  hang the words: GAME OVER.

You can award them 3000 XP for finishing An 8-Bit Adventure. 

### Post-Adventure
Items obtained in Retroguardia can continue to work. They are already based on the 5e rules.

Gil is virtually worthless. They might be able to sell it for 1cp per Gil if they can find a buyer.

These events seem pretty fantastic, even by the standards of most other settings. The party may have a hard time getting others to believe them.

# Appendix A: Items
